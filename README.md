To formulate a C program to convert a decimal number into its binary equivalent and display it.
# Algorithm:
### Step 1:
  Start
### Step 2: 
  Include the standard input-output library: #include<stdio.h>.
### Step 3: 
  Declare variables: num (input number), rem (remainder), binary[] (array to store binary digits), and loop counters i and k.
### Step 4: 
  Read the decimal number from the user.
### Step 5: 
  Initialize i = 0.
### Step 6:

  Develop a C program to read a matrix and find its saddle point. A saddle point is an element that is the minimum in its row and also the maximum in its column. If such an element exists, display its position and value.
# Date : 
# Aim:
  To develop a C program that inputs a matrix, checks each row for its minimum element, verifies whether that element is also the maximum in its corresponding column, and displays the saddle point and its position if it exists.
# Algorithm:
### Step 1:
  Start
### Step 2: 
  Include the standard input-output library: #include<stdio.h>.
### Step 3: 
 Declare variables i, j, k, m, min, max and a position array pos[2][2].
### Step 4: 
 Read the order of the square matrix m.
### Step 5: 
 Declare an m × m matrix and read its elements.
### Step 6: 
 Display the matrix.
### Step 7: 
   For each row `i` from `0` to `m−1`:
- **Step 7.1:** Set `min` as the first element of the row.  
- **Step 7.2:** Scan the row to find its minimum element and store its position in `pos[0]`.  
- **Step 7.3:** Let `j` be the column of this minimum element.  
- **Step 7.4:** Set `max` as the first element of column `j`.  
- **Step 7.5:** Scan column `j` to find its maximum element and store its position in `pos[1]`.  
### Step 8: 
  Check if the row minimum equals the column maximum:
- If `min == max` **and their positions match**, then the element is a **saddle point**.
- Print the saddle point value and its position.
### Step 9: 
  Stop

  Formulate a C program to reverse a string entered by the user and display the reversed string.
# Date : 
# Aim:
  To formulate a C program that reads a string from the user, reverses it, and prints the reversed string.
# Algorithm:
### Step 1:
  Start
### Step 2: 
  Include the standard input-output library: #include<stdio.h>.
### Step 3: 
  Declare two character arrays: `s` to store the input string and `d` to store the reversed string.
### Step 4: 
  Read the string from the user using `scanf("%[^\n]s", s);`
### Step 5: 
  Find the length of the string `s` by traversing it until the null character `'\0'` is encountered.
### Step 6: 
  Initialize a counter `j` for the reversed string.
### Step 7: 
  Copy characters from the end of `s` to the beginning of `d` using a loop until all characters are copied in reverse order.
### Step 8: 
  Terminate the reversed string `d` with the null character `'\0'`.
### Step 9: 
  Print the reversed string.
### Step 10:

  Formulate a C program to count the frequency of each character in a given string and display the count of every character.
# Date : 
# Aim:
  To formulate a C program that accepts a string from the user and calculates the frequency of each character in the string.
# Algorithm:
### Step 1:
  Start
### Step 2: 
  Include the standard input-output library: #include<stdio.h>.
### Step 3: 
  Declare a character array `s[100]` to store the input string, an integer array `visited[256]` initialized to `0`, and variables `i`, `n`, and `count`.
### Step 4: 
  Read the string from the user using `scanf("%[^\n]", s);`
### Step 5: 
  Calculate the length of the string using `strlen(s)` and store it in `n`.
### Step 6: 
 For each character `s[i]` in the string (from `i = 0` to `n - 1`):
 - If `visited[(unsigned char)s[i]] == 0` (character not yet counted):  
  - Initialize `count = 0`.  
  - Loop through the string again and increment `count` for every occurrence of `s[i]`.  
  - Print `s[i]` and its count.  
  - Set `visited[(unsigned char)s[i]] = 1` to mark it as counted.
### Step 7: 
  Repeat Step 6 for all characters.
### Step 8:

  Formulate a C program to remove duplicate words from a given string and display the string with only unique words.
# Date : 
# Aim:
  To formulate a C program to remove duplicate words from a given string and display the string with only unique words.
# Algorithm:
### Step 1:
  Start
### Step 2: 
  Include the standard input-output library: #include<stdio.h>.
### Step 3: 
  Declare a character array `str` to store the input string and a 2D array `words` to store individual words.
### Step 4: 
  Read the input string using `scanf("%[^\n]s", str);`
### Step 5: 
 Split the string into words:
 - Traverse the string character by character.  
 - When a space is encountered, terminate the current word with `'\0'` and move to the next row in `words`.  
 - Otherwise, copy the character into the current word.
### Step 6: 
  Compare each word with all other words to detect duplicates:
  - If a duplicate is found, mark it by setting the first character to `'\0'`.
### Step 7: 
  Print all words that are not marked as duplicates.
### Step 8: 
  Stop
